#  Fellowship Documents

Included here are materials from national fellowships or scholarships I have successfully applied to. Currently I have materials for three such fellowships: the Barry Goldwater Scholarship, the Churchill Scholarship, and the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship. Hopefully my essays and research proposals prove useful to current or future applicants who stumble onto this repository. If you an applicant, please don't hesitate to reach out and I will do my best to help.
